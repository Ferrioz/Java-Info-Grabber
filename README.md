# Requirements
 1. I guess JRE, JVM idk

<br>

# Features
 - Transfers information via Discord webhook
 - Searches for IP Address, Operating System, Username
 - Cross-platform support

<br>

# How to use
 1. Set the variable URL found in src/me/ferrioz/nineMalware/Connection/Discord/verifyWebhook.java to your webhook URL.
 2. Obfuscate or just build the JAR instantly. Who cares right?
 3. Send the JAR to your victim and somehow make them run it.

 # TODO
  1. More grabbers in general
  2. Some sort of debug logging through webhooks to identify any errors
